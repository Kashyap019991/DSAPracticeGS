Given an orders_log table that records all events for orders,
with columns order_id, timestamp,
status, and cust_id,
write a query to find all order_ids which have the status as processing,
processed, and completed (i.e., the order has gone through all three steps).


SELECT order_id
FROM orders_log
WHERE status IN ('processing', 'processed', 'completed')
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT status) = 3;
